(this was august of 2012 mind you) of course the dealership lost the paper work. after countless number of phone calls to them i was told that it would be taken care of! still two months after it was supposed to be cancelled i was still being charged for it! so i took matters into my own hands and called the warranty company myself to get it cancelled,, it is now jan 6th, 2013 and i have called numerous times and left a million messages and not one time has anyone called me back to say that things are being taken care of and we will be getting our refund!!!! i've never dealt with a worse car dealership then this one and would not recommend them to anyone!!",
